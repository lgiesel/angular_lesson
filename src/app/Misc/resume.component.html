<!-- Create another tab - playground

<!-- lifecycle hooks - OnInit - angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks -  there are several
	CLI generated oninit hook - only need this for PRS
	Others exist tho

<!-- ONE WAY BINDING

{{textForAdmin}}
	Binding label to data in that property ; all have to do is change data
	ng takes care of binding data to UI

Today is not Tuesday

The text: An admin clicked the button

Button for Admins only!	
===================

Data binding

<component 	html
astring		{{astring}}
only have to change component astring once and anywhere that {{}} displays only chg data
CHANGE DATA TO CHANGE UI!!!!! - ONE WAY BINDING
COMP.TS IS WHERE CODE GOES
COMP.SPEC FILE IS FOR AUTOMATIC TESTING
-->
	
<!-- ngIf notes

*ngIf Go to Resume and see following if Tuesday true
	HOME RESUME ABOUT
	Today is Tuesday

	Button appears - Button for Admins only! 

	IF NOT TUESDAY
	Today is not Tuesday

	Button for Admins only!

	IF no admin or not Tues
	Today is not Tuesday
	W no button                     

	Interpolation takes data out of component and puts on screen  
	*ngIf doesnt fire until user has data in it ; until call DB, user is null-  relates to asynchronous request/response 

		*nfIf 
    	Can be on any html tag
		Applies to all under that tag
		Can have nested *ngIf within another *ngIf
